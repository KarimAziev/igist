#+TITLE: Changelog

* v1.6.0    2024-03-12

** New commands:

- Added a new command =igist-list-edit-gist-at-point-async= for displaying editable buffers asynchronously. The existing =igist-list-edit-gist-at-point= command is still available, but its keybinding has changed to the new command.
- Introduced =igist-kill-all-edit-buffers= to close all igist buffers where =igist-edit-mode= is active. Updated keybindings in the transient menu to include the "Kill all edit buffers" option with the shortcut "x e".

** Fixes:

- Ensured timer cancellation occurs before function execution. This change possibly fixes issue #7.
- Improved management and display of error and loading states in gist editing buffers.
- Explicitly specify =:class= transient-column in transient definitions using :setup-children, following a change highlighted by commit [beecdc8](https://github.com/magit/transient/commit/beecdc85799231338314bd20292f71fc8cd687e8) in the transient library to prevent warnings and ensure future compatibility.

** Improvements:

- Enhanced time difference formatting in tables.
- External gists are now read-only.


* v1.5.1    2023-11-10

** Refactor
- Unused functions =igist-render-files= and =igist-tabulated-list--column-number= have been removed to clean up the codebase.
** Documentation
- Correct typos in documentation strings.
- Updated README.

* v1.5.0    2023-10-21
** Performance Improvements:
 - The =igist= has switched to its own rendering engine from =tabulated-list-mode=, resulting in improved performance and more customization options. Additionally, a new mode for exploring public gists, called =igist-explore-mode=, has been derived from =igist-list-mode=.

** Command changes:
  - Improved the =igist-table-menu= function to increase its control over table columns. It now lets you dynamically modify several column properties, such as adding new columns, changing padding and alignment, renaming columns, modifying their width, and sorting them.
  - Changed the behavior of =igist-tabulated-list-widen-current-column=. To avoid performance issues, some entries may now update to the new width immediately, while others may update after a slight delay. This debouncing mechanism prevents multiple quick successions of call executions, thereby improving overall performance and providing immediate visual feedback for the resizing operation.

** New Commands:
  - Added =igist-filters-menu=, a transient prefix command that allows for filtering by languages (=igist-toggle-language-filter=), files (=igist-search-files=), and descriptions (=igist-search-by-descriptions=). By default, it's bound to =/= in list buffers.
  - Introduced =igist-clone-gist=, a new command for cloning gists, which is bound to =C= in list buffers by default.
  - Introduced commands for navigating and previewing entries: =igist-list-backward-row-and-preview= (bound to =C-M-n= in lists buffer), and =igist-list-forward-row-and-preview= (bound to =C-M-p= in lists buffer).

** Custom Variables:
  - =igist-immediate-resize-strategy=: Controls the resizing strategy for tabulated entries when using =igist-tabulated-list-widen-current-column=.
  - =igist-user-gists-init-collapsed= and =igist-explore-gists-init-collapsed=: Control the default collapsed state in user and exploration buffers, respectively.
  - =igist-clone-default-directory=: Specifies the default directory for =igist-clone-gist=.
  - =igist-use-header-line=: Determines whether the Igist List buffer uses a header line or an overlay.
  - =igist-tabulated-list-padding=: Sets character padding for each Igist List mode entry.
  - =igist-tabulated-list-tty-sort-indicator-desc=, =igist-tabulated-list-tty-sort-indicator-asc=: Indicate the sort order in =text-mode= frames.
  - =igist-tabulated-list-gui-sort-indicator-desc=, =igist-tabulated-list-gui-sort-indicator-asc=: Indicate the sort order in =gui= frames.
