#+TITLE: Changelog

* v1.8.0    2025-10-23

** Changes:
Updated Emacs version support to 29.1 and above. Because =igist= depends on =ghub=, which dropped support for older versions, =igist= also drops support for older Emacs versions.

** Improvements:
Honor current-prefix-arg in =igist-change-user= and =igist-set-current-user=: when a prefix argument is given, always present a completing-read populated from auth-source, allowing the user to choose from saved GitHub accounts.

** Fixes:
Corrected the logic that retrieves the default directory when cloning gists.


* v1.7.0    2025-03-13
** New commands:
- Added a new command, =igist-copy-gist-raw-url=, which copies the raw URL of a gist to the clipboard. It works in both tabulated views and in edit mode. The command is also available in the transient menu and is bound to "W".

* v1.6.4    2024-11-08
- This release doesn't introduce any new features or bug fixes. Instead, it replaces the use of =if-let= and =when-let=, which are obsolete as of Emacs 31.x.

* v1.6.3    2024-07-13

** Fixes:

- Fixed the bug for Emacs versions that lack native JSON support. Due to incorrect response parsing, gists were not rendered. (#8)

* v1.6.2    2024-06-08

** Fixes:

- Resolved issue where the =igist= list sometimes returned an empty list after a long processing time by using =igist--request= instead of =ghub-request=. This also fixes another bug caused by the latest version of ghub (magit/ghub@2061136) where only the first page of gists was loaded, and subsequent pages were not fetched. (#7)

** Minor Changes:
- Excluded igist mode-specific commands from the completion list in non-relevant modes to improve user experience and reduce clutter in the command completion list.

* v1.6.1    2024-03-22

** Custom Variables:

- Added a new option, "Auto," to the =igist-ask-for-description= customization, allowing for the automatic generation of descriptions when creating or updating gists.
- The unused custom variable =igist-debug-enabled-p= has been renamed to =igist-debug=. Conditional debug logging has also been added to some functions.

** Fixes:

- Refetch the gist buffer if it has not been modified.
- Corrected the setting of the major mode in new Gist buffers.
- Ensure list buffer respects non-nil background argument during loading.

* v1.6.0    2024-03-12

** New commands:

- Added a new command =igist-list-edit-gist-at-point-async= for displaying editable buffers asynchronously. The existing =igist-list-edit-gist-at-point= command is still available, but its keybinding has changed to the new command.
- Introduced =igist-kill-all-edit-buffers= to close all igist buffers where =igist-edit-mode= is active. Updated keybindings in the transient menu to include the "Kill all edit buffers" option with the shortcut "x e".

** Fixes:

- Ensured timer cancellation occurs before function execution. This change possibly fixes issue #7.
- Improved management and display of error and loading states in gist editing buffers.
- Explicitly specify =:class= transient-column in transient definitions using :setup-children, following a change highlighted by commit [beecdc8](https://github.com/magit/transient/commit/beecdc85799231338314bd20292f71fc8cd687e8) in the transient library to prevent warnings and ensure future compatibility.

** Improvements:

- Enhanced time difference formatting in tables.
- External gists are now read-only.


* v1.5.1    2023-11-10

** Refactor
- Unused functions =igist-render-files= and =igist-tabulated-list--column-number= have been removed to clean up the codebase.
** Documentation
- Correct typos in documentation strings.
- Updated README.

* v1.5.0    2023-10-21
** Performance Improvements:
 - The =igist= has switched to its own rendering engine from =tabulated-list-mode=, resulting in improved performance and more customization options. Additionally, a new mode for exploring public gists, called =igist-explore-mode=, has been derived from =igist-list-mode=.

** Command changes:
  - Improved the =igist-table-menu= function to increase its control over table columns. It now lets you dynamically modify several column properties, such as adding new columns, changing padding and alignment, renaming columns, modifying their width, and sorting them.
  - Changed the behavior of =igist-tabulated-list-widen-current-column=. To avoid performance issues, some entries may now update to the new width immediately, while others may update after a slight delay. This debouncing mechanism prevents multiple quick successions of call executions, thereby improving overall performance and providing immediate visual feedback for the resizing operation.

** New Commands:
  - Added =igist-filters-menu=, a transient prefix command that allows for filtering by languages (=igist-toggle-language-filter=), files (=igist-search-files=), and descriptions (=igist-search-by-descriptions=). By default, it's bound to =/= in list buffers.
  - Introduced =igist-clone-gist=, a new command for cloning gists, which is bound to =C= in list buffers by default.
  - Introduced commands for navigating and previewing entries: =igist-list-backward-row-and-preview= (bound to =C-M-n= in lists buffer), and =igist-list-forward-row-and-preview= (bound to =C-M-p= in lists buffer).

** Custom Variables:
  - =igist-immediate-resize-strategy=: Controls the resizing strategy for tabulated entries when using =igist-tabulated-list-widen-current-column=.
  - =igist-user-gists-init-collapsed= and =igist-explore-gists-init-collapsed=: Control the default collapsed state in user and exploration buffers, respectively.
  - =igist-clone-default-directory=: Specifies the default directory for =igist-clone-gist=.
  - =igist-use-header-line=: Determines whether the Igist List buffer uses a header line or an overlay.
  - =igist-tabulated-list-padding=: Sets character padding for each Igist List mode entry.
  - =igist-tabulated-list-tty-sort-indicator-desc=, =igist-tabulated-list-tty-sort-indicator-asc=: Indicate the sort order in =text-mode= frames.
  - =igist-tabulated-list-gui-sort-indicator-desc=, =igist-tabulated-list-gui-sort-indicator-asc=: Indicate the sort order in =gui= frames.

* v1.4.1    2023-08-19
** Fixes
- Fixed sorting triggered by clicking on the header line.
- Fixed an issue where =igist-edit-mode= and the related local variables were lost after changing major mode.

* v1.4.0    2023-08-17

** New commands:
  - =igist-post-files= Post multiple files. In Dired it creates a gist from marked files.
  - =igist-print-languages-chart= Print a chart with language occurrences.
  - =igist-swap-current-column= Swap current column with the next one.
  - =igist-swap-current-column-backward= Swap current column with the previous one.
  - =igist-list-remove-column= Remove column.
** Fixes:
  - Fix column resizing for Emacs versions prior to 29.

 - In tabulated views, bind =G= to the revert command.
 - Add Cask and Makefile for building and testing the package.
